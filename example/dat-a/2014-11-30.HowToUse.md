* To convert using Github API (requires Internet)
```
DATUM_DAT_A="<markdown-blog>" ./dat-2-um.sh
```
> this would create a "blog-site" directory in parent-dir of "<markdown-blog>" and then copy over the default boilerplate of "zurblog" with converted blogs in it

* To convert using Pandoc utlity (need to be installed using cabal)
```
DATUM_CONVERTER="pandoc" DATUM_DAT_A="<markdown-blog>" ./dat-2-um.sh
```

* To convert using Pandoc utlity and place it in desired destination "<html-blogdir>"
```
DATUM_CONVERTER="pandoc" DATUM_DAT_A="<markdown-blog>" DATUM_W3DATA="<html-blogdir>" ./dat-2-um.sh
```
> this would create a "<html-blogdir>" directory in parent-dir of "<markdown-blog>" and then copy over the default boilerplate of "zurblog" with converted blogs in it

* if got some other boilerplate for blog
```
DATUM_BOILERPLATE=bootlog DATUM_CONVERTER="pandoc" DATUM_BASEDIR="example/" ./dat-2-um.sh
```
> This will apply "bootlog" boilerplate (if exists). Here you see "DATUM_BASEDIR" variable being used, it depicts a parent dir where "markdown" and "generated-html" both can reside if not defined explicitly. Since neither "DATUM_W3DATA" nor "DATUM_DAT_A" have been defined here, the value expected for them would be "DATUM_BASEDIR/blog-site" and "DATUM_BASEDIR/dat-a" respectively.
